# ðŸš€ Running Locally

## Obtain an API key 

Obtain an api key from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/price). 

Under the src folder in the project run `mkdir environments` to create a new folder for environment variables.

Under this new folder create a *environment.ts* file containing this code:

```
export const environment = {
    production: false,
    apiKey: ''
  };
```

Where apiKey contains the string value of your free api key.


## Install Dependencies

Run `npm i` to install all dependencies.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
